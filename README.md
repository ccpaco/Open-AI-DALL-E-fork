# Creating images from text - the early stages ;


Greetings, world! Here I've got the starter version of DALL-E from OpenAI. You can see their full build at [their website.](https://openai.com/blog/dall-e/)


I've decided to spend 2020-2021, amidst the global COVID-19 Pandemic, to greatly improve myself as a developer. Naturally, in full Elon Musk fashion, I'm jumping headlong into Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence. 


The barrier isn't as hard to overcome as you think. 


You can follow along in this journey by checking out the blog, [ccpaco.github.io](ccpaco.github.io). I try to write tutorial and motivational articles for fellow self-taught developers. 


And if you're looking directly for the main Jupyter file where all our magic happens, it's [here. ](https://github.com/ccpaco/Open-AI-DALL-E-fork/blob/main/notebooks/usage.ipynb)


Don't forget to use the command-line to set everything up and install Python dependencies and libraries. I found Anaconda particularly valuable. And, there's always my blog for quick reference.

Best, 


Chris

# Overview

[[Blog]](https://openai.com/blog/dall-e/) [[Paper]](https://arxiv.org/abs/2102.12092) [[Model Card]](model_card.md) [[Usage]](notebooks/usage.ipynb)

This is the official PyTorch package for the discrete VAE used for DALL·E. The transformer used to generate the images from the text is not part of this code release.

# Installation

Before running [the example notebook](notebooks/usage.ipynb), you will need to install the package using

	pip install DALL-E
