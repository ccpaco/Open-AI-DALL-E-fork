# Creating images from text - the early stages ;


Greetings, world! Here I've got the starter version of DALL-E from OpenAI. You can see their full build at [their website.](https://openai.com/blog/dall-e/)


I've decided to spend 2020-2021, amidst the global COVID-19 Pandemic, to greatly improve myself as a developer. Naturally, in full Elon Musk fashion, I'm jumping headlong into Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence. 


The barrier isn't as hard to overcome as you think. 


You can follow along in this journey by checking out the blog, ccpaco.github.io. I try to write tutorial and motivational articles for fellow self-taught developers. 


Best, 


Chris

This is the official PyTorch package for the discrete VAE used for DALLÂ·E. The transformer used to generate the images from the text is not part of this code release.

# Installation
